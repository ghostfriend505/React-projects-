<h2> ⚛️ Counter App (React + Vite) </h1>

A simple Counter App built using React and Vite to learn the fundamentals of React with a modern setup.

This is the first project in the React Projects series and focuses on understanding state, events, and re-rendering.


<h2> 🚀 Why Vite (Instead of create-react-app) </h2>

We used Vite because it is the modern and recommended way to build React apps.

<h3>  ❌ create-react-app (old)  </h3>

  🔹 slow startup

  🔹 slow reload

  🔹 heavy setup

  🔹 deprecated

<h3> ✅ Vite (modern) </h3>

  🔹 instant start ⚡

  🔹 fast hot reload

  🔹 smaller bundle

  🔹 used in real companies

  🔹 recommended by React docs

    npm create vite@latest appname

<h1>Project Setup (Step by Step )</h1>

  <h2>Create project</h2>

      npm create vite@latest 01-counter-app

      npm install


<h3> Start dev server </h3>

      npm run dev

Open in 

      http://localhost:5173

<h2> ⭐ Final Note </h2>

Don’t rush.
Build. Break. Fix. Repeat.
