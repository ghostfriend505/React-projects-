## 🚀 Why Vite (instead of create-react-app)

There are two ways to start a React project:

### ❌ Old way (create-react-app)

    npx create-react-app my-app

Problems:

  🔹 slow startup

  🔹 slow reload

  🔹 heavy bundle

  🔹 deprecated by React team



<h2> Modern way (Vite – recommended) </h2>

      npm create vite@latest my-app


Why we use Vite:

  🔹 instant dev server

  🔹 fast hot reload

  🔹 smaller bundle

  🔹 modern ES modules

  🔹 used in real companies

   🔹 recommended by React docs
  
  All projects in this repo use Vite only.
